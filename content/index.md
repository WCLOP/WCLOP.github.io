## Summary

This workshop aims to establish a comprehensive evaluation benchmark for category-level object pose estimation in the wild, addressing the community's need for robust, large-scale challenges. Traditional methods often overfit to smaller datasets, such as NOCS REAL275, limiting their applicability and scalability. The recent availability of extensive datasets like OmniNOCS, PACE, and Omni6DPose presents an opportune moment to critically examine and enhance state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. This workshop will explore advanced methodologies and foster discussions on creating more generalized models that perform effectively across diverse and challenging real-world scenarios.

### Reasearch Questions

The workshop will investigate several critical research questions:
- **Benchmarking and Evaluation Metrics**: What are the most effective metrics and benchmarks for evaluating pose estimation models on large-scale datasets, and how do these influence model development?
- **Generalization Across Datasets**: How can models be designed to generalize better across different datasets without sacrificing performance on specific datasets?
- **Adaptation and Transfer Learning**: What strategies can be employed to adapt models trained on simulated, smaller datasets to perform well on real-world, larger datasets?

### Workshop Objectives

- Foster a deeper understanding of the challenges associated with category-level object pose estimation in varied environments.
- Encourage the development and sharing of innovative techniques that ensure robust model performance on large-scale datasets.
- Promote community-wide collaboration to continually refine benchmarks and methodologies, advancing the field of computer vision.

### Expected Benefits

- Gaining insights into the latest research and technological advancements in category-level pose estimation.
- Engaging with leading experts to discuss the current challenges and future directions of the field.
- Accessing new tools and frameworks that facilitate the development of more effective and adaptable pose estimation models.

By focusing on these aspects, the workshop intends to catalyze significant advancements in object pose estimation, particularly through rigorous benchmarking and community-driven research initiatives.

## Call for papers

We welcome submissions of full papers (up to 8 pages) and short papers (up to 4 pages), excluding references and appendices. All submissions must adhere to the CVPR 2025 format and will undergo peer review by domain experts. Accepted papers will be featured either as oral presentations or posters during the workshop. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Category-level 6D object pose estimation and tracking
- Open-vocabulary object segmentation and 6D pose estimation
- 6D pose estimation for optically challenging objects, such as transparent or reflective surfaces
- Pose-aware robotics: leveraging object pose in autonomous robotic systems

We encourage novel research that pushes the boundaries of category-level object pose estimation, with a focus on real-world challenges and applications.
