# Speaker Bio

Xiaolong Wang is recognized for his contributions to computer vision, machine learning, and robotics, with specific expertise in learning visual representations that connect image understanding to 3D structure and robotics. His research on sim-to-real generalizable feature learning and [6D pose estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15436) aligns well with the workshop's theme of enhancing category-level pose estimation in the wild.
