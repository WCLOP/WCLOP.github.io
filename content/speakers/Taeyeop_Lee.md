talk_title: "6D Object Pose Estimation for Robot Manipulation"
---

# Talk Abstract

This talk explores the evolution from manufacturing manipulation to physical-level manipulation in robotics. While manufacturing systems achieve high precision, accuracy, and proven safety, they lack generalization capabilities and remain limited to single-task operations. Our goal is to develop Physical AI that combines manufacturing-level precision and safety with general-purpose generalization for multi-task manipulation.
