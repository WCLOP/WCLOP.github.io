# Speaker Bio

Taeyeop Lee's work focuses on understanding 3D worlds through geometry and semantics, specifically in Computer Vision and Robotics, which is crucial for advancing how pose estimation can be optimized for interactive and responsive robotics applications. He is also the author of many advanced pose-estimation algorithms such as [TTA-COPE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.16730).
