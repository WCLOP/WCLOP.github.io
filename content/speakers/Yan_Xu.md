# Speaker Bio

Yan Xu's research intersects computer vision, robotics, and embodied AI, focusing on actionable representation learning from natural data, which is pivotal for autonomous systems like those used in category-level pose estimation. His work on [object pose estimation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10416758) and [object localization](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=zh-CN&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=+NeRF-Loc%3A+Transformer-Based+Object+Localization+Within+Neural+Radiance+Fields&btnG=) is highly relevant for developing accurate and scalable pose estimation algorithms.
