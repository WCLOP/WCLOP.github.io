# Speaker Bio

Benjamin Busam is Professor and Director of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing at the Technical University of Munich. He previously served as Head of Research at FRAMOS Imaging Systems and led the 3D Computer Vision Team at Huawei Research London (2018–2020). Benjamin studied Mathematics in Munich, Paris, and Melbourne before earning a PhD in Computer Science. He regularly serves on the programme committees of leading computer vision and robotics conferences including CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, IROS, and ICRA. His team’s research centres on 3D computer vision and robotics for embodied AI, with a focus on multi-modal sensor fusion, self- and physics-supervised learning, and robust perception of photometrically challenging objects.

# Talk Abstract

Achieving human-like 3D perception requires unifying geometry, appearance, and semantics. This talk explores advances in category-level object pose estimation - a necessary step toward generalizable 3D understanding beyond controlled lab setups. We discuss how systems can infer object pose under real-world variations in lighting, texture, and occlusion by fusing geometric reasoning with photometric and semantic cues from RGB-D data, inspired by 3D reconstruction and registration pipelines. Leveraging global category priors and semantic shape reconstruction, we outline a path toward physically grounded, data-driven perception where machines can perceive and reason about the 3D world with human-like fluency.
